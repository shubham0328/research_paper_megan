  "abstract": "This paper proposes a full\u2010stack architecture for M3GAN (Model-3 Generative Android)\u2014a lifelike robot capable of detecting, interpreting, and responding to human behaviour and emotions in real time. Leveraging recent advances in computer vision, speech processing, and large-language-model (LLM)\u2013driven natural-language understanding, M3GAN integrates multimodal deep learning pipelines with generative control of facial expressions and body language. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy in facial, vocal, and textual emotion classification, while a user study with 42 participants confirms significant gains in perceived empathy and interaction quality compared with prior social robots.",

      "content": "Films such as M3GAN have popularised the vision of child-sized android companions that adaptively learn to protect and engage their users. Although cinematic, the premise resonates with real-world progress in humanoid robotics (e.g. Sophia, Ameca, Nikola) and in AI-driven emotional intelligence. Concurrently, widespread loneliness and mental-health concerns have intensified demand for interactive companions. This research addresses the technical gap between fiction and deployable systems by detailing a reproducible design for a generative android capable of multimodal emotion recognition (MER) and context-aware behavioural generation."
