  "title": "M3GAN: A Generative Android Robot for Real-Time Multimodal Emotion and Behavior Analysis",
  "abstract": "This paper proposes a full\u2010stack architecture for M3GAN (Model-3 Generative Android)\u2014a lifelike robot capable of detecting, interpreting, and responding to human behaviour and emotions in real time. Leveraging recent advances in computer vision, speech processing, and large-language-model (LLM)\u2013driven natural-language understanding, M3GAN integrates multimodal deep learning pipelines with generative control of facial expressions and body language.",

Although cinematic, the premise resonates with real-world progress in humanoid robotics (e.g. Sophia, Ameca, Nikola) and in AI-driven emotional intelligence."
